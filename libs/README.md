## Scripts
From the root directory of the project:

### Build
- **Build all libraries**:
  ```bash
  pnpm build:libs
  ```

### Testing
- **Run tests for all libraries**:
  ```bash
  pnpm test:all
  ```
- **Run tests for a specific library** (replace `$PROJECT`):
  ```bash
  PROJECT=cdk-card pnpm test:project
  ```
- **Run tests with Vitest UI**: (replace `$PROJECT`):
  ```bash
  PROJECT=cdk-card pnpm test:project:ui
  ```

### Library Creation
- **Create a new standard library**:
  ```bash
  pnpm new:lib --name=my-lib
  ```
- **Create a new CDK library**:
  ```bash
  pnpm new:cdk:lib --name=my-cdk-lib
  ```

## Notes
1. The libraries are configured to be consumed both by the monorepo applications and by future projects.
2. You can use `pnpm graph` to visualize the relationships between applications and libraries in the monorepo.

3. Library configuration uses `Nx` to optimize tasks with smart caching.
